# mbusJS

A small, slightly incomplete, library to read MBus data using JavaScript.

This library was originaly developed as a part of a Chrome App (UtilityMeterViewer),
but since Google decided to stop supporting Chrome Apps, that application has been put on ice
until the community can agree on how to handle "serial ports" in Progressive Webapps.

## Known missing features
- Documentation
- Secondary address support
- Multiple frame support
- You tell me...

## What works
- Reading data using primary addressing 1-247)
- Interpreting the MBus frame into a JavaScript structure
